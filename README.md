# NYC Citi Bikesharing

## Purpose
The purpose of this exercise was to analyze the New York City bike-sharing data using Tableau Public and present the analysis to potential investors interested in starting a bike-sharing program in other cities.

### Visualizations
As follows are the descriptions and visualizations I created:

1. Number of rides by riders' year of birth: help understand the age profile of the riders

2. Gender breakdown of the riders

3. The circles represent the top starting locations of the rides on the map. The larger the circle the more rides started from that bike station.

4. The circles represent the top ending locations of the rides on the map. Larger the circle the more rides terminated at that bike station.

5. Sum of total rides taken during August 2019

6. Shows in hours and minutes the trip duration.

7. Trip duration in hours and minutes by the gender of the rider

8. Heatmap demonstrating the trip frequency by gender of the rider each day of the week

9. Heatmap demonstrating the trip frequency by gender of the rider each day of the week (by the hour)

10. Heatmap demonstrating the trip frequency each day of the week

11. Pie-chart depicting the percentage of customer type i.e. subscribers vs. customer

## Summary
Based on my analysis, there is a broad appeal for bike-sharing services in NYC. While the most frequent riders tend to be young males, users of all ages and gender utilize the service. A high percentage of riders subscribe to the service. So anyone starting a bike-sharing company in other cities should consider a similar subscription model. 

Further analysis is needed to understand the number of bikes needed to adequately serve a market to ensure that riders always have bikes available, especially during peak hours at the busiest stops. I recommend the following visualizations:
1. Using the trip start time, trip end time, and location data, calculate the number of bikes at the top 10 trip starting locations
2. Determine the maximum percentage of bikes in use during the peak hours throughout the week
